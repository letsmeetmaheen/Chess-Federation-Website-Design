# ✅ Registration System - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** When clicking "Registrations" in admin panel, the page showed the homepage instead of the registrations data table.

**Root Cause:** Routing logic in `App.tsx` was incorrect. The admin page names like 'registrations', 'dashboard', etc. were not recognized as admin pages, causing the app to render the public homepage instead.

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### **1. Fixed Routing Logic in `/App.tsx`**

**Before (Broken):**
```tsx
if (currentPage === 'home' || !currentPage.startsWith('admin')) {
  return <PublicWebsite />;
}
```
❌ Problem: 'registrations' doesn't start with 'admin', so it showed homepage

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
const adminPages = ['admin', 'dashboard', 'members', 'events', 
                    'registrations', 'players', 'gallery', 
                    'announcements', 'puzzles', 'settings'];

if (currentPage === 'home' || !adminPages.includes(currentPage)) {
  return <PublicWebsite />;
}
```
✅ Solution: Explicitly list all admin pages to check against

---

### **2. Enhanced Registrations Data Table**

Added visual improvements to `/admin/RegistrationsPage.tsx`:

#### **Quick Guide Card** (Top of page)
- ✅ Shows what actions admin can take
- 🎯 Clear instructions: Approve, Reject, Delete
- 📊 Visual icons for each action

#### **Improved Empty State**
- 🎨 Better visual design with icon
- 📝 Helpful messages based on context
- 💡 Guides users on what to expect

---

### **3. Added Sample Registration Data**

Added 5 sample registrations in `/contexts/DataContext.tsx`:
- **3 Pending** - Need admin review
- **1 Approved** - Already accepted
- **1 Rejected** - Already declined

This allows you to test the system immediately!
